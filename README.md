# Trivrr
a trivia game, this app will display a word from one language and 4 options from the language the user need to learn and only one of them is right. Pretty similar to trivia.

This app is aimed to begginers who want to practice the basic words of a language, those who wants to practice words about certain themes, in general, or in case if you are struggling with specific set of words.

This app will use Angular for the front-end and python for the back-end.
